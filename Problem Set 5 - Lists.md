1.	You are a company owner. Write a Python script that asks the user how many employees work in your company. Then, for each employee, ask for their name and the number of hours they worked this week. Store the names in one list and the hours in another. Finally, print both lists.
Allow the owner to input any name of an employee and then a printout will give the employees names and the amount of hours they have worked.


2.	A teacher wants to find out how well their students are doing. Write a Python script that asks the user how many students are in a class. For each student, ask for their name and their grade. Store the names in one list and the grades in another. After collecting the data, print the list of names and the list of grades.
   
3.	Adapt Question 2. Input a list of subjects. From the list of users in Q2, ask the members of this list what grade they got in each subject in the list of subjects. Each user then gets a list of subjects and grades.
