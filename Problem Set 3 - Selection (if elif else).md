\
**1.	Write a program to display the following menu of options:**
Menu
1.	Music
2.	History
3.	Design and Technology
4.	Exit
Please enter your choice:
The user then enters a choice and the program prints a message such as “You chose History”. If they choose option 4, the program prints “Goodbye”
\
**2.	Write a program to simulate the throw of 2 dice (each between 1 and 6)**.
  Print the numbers representing the two throws.

If the numbers on the two dice are not equal, the player’s score is the sum. Print the score

If the numbers on the two dice are equal, the player scores twice the sum of the number thrown. Print “You threw a double” and the score








3.	Write a program that asks the user to enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
Based on the temperature, print a message:
•	30 or above: “It’s very hot today. Stay hydrated!”
•	20 to 29: “Nice weather. Enjoy your day!”
•	10 to 19: “It’s a bit chilly. Wear a jacket.”
•	Below 10: “It’s cold. Bundle up!”
If the user enters a value below -50 or above 50, print: “That doesn’t seem like a real temperature!”

4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password.
Then check the password and print a message based on its length:
•	12 or more characters: “Strong password.”
•	8 to 11 characters: “Moderate password.”
•	Less than 8 characters: “Weak password. Try something longer.”
You can optionally add a check to see if the password contains a number or special character for extra challenge.


5.	Write a program that asks the user to enter their age.
Then use the following rules to calculate the bus fare:
•	Under 5: Free
•	5 to 18: Child fare: €1.20
•	19 to 64: Adult fare: €2.50
•	65 and over: Senior fare: €1.00
Print the appropriate message with the fare.


6.	Write a program that asks the user to enter the name of an animal:
cat, dog, cow, or duck.
The program should then print the sound that animal makes:
•	cat → “Meow”
•	dog → “Woof”
•	cow → “Moo”
•	duck → “Quack”
If the user enters an animal not on the list, print:
“Sorry, I don’t know that animal.”
