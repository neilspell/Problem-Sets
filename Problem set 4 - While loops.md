1.	Set a total to 0 to start with. While the number is 50 or less, ask the user to input a number. Add that number to the total and print the message “The total is [total]”. Stop the loop when the total is over 50.
   
2.	Ask the user to enter a number between 10 and 20. If they enter a value under 10 display the message “Too Low” and ask them to try again. If they enter a value above 20, display the message “Too High” and ask them to try again. Keep repeating this until they enter a value that is between 10 and 20 and then display the message “Thank You”
